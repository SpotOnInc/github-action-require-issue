### Writing documentation

To run the docs locally, ensure that you have `python3` available in your path and run `make docs`. If this is the first time you've run the command, it will automatically build the proper environment and then start a local server to access the rendered docs. Otherwise, it will just start the server. You can access the local docs server at `http://localhost:8383`. Press CTRL+C to stop.
